# model-card-creator

you get familiar with model cards. A model card is a standardized document that provides information about a machine learning model, such as its intended use, performance characteristics, and potential limitations. Model cards are used to promote transparency and accountability in machine learning, and they are becoming increasingly important as machine learning models are used in more critical applications.

The abstraction built over the model toolkit in this code repository provides a standardized way to generate model cards for your machine learning models. It includes pre-defined templates for different types of models, along with tools to help you fill in the required information. The abstraction also includes validation tools to ensure that the model card meets the necessary standards.

Overall, this code repository provides a streamlined way to generate model cards for your machine learning models, which can help promote transparency and accountability in your work. By using this abstraction built over the model toolkit, you can focus more on the substance of your machine learning models and less on the administrative details of creating model cards.
